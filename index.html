      <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 15px auto; line-height: 1.6;">
        I am Alfredo Gaspar, Head Coach of Fontana Fire FC in Fontana, California.
        Soccer has been a part of my life since the age of three, and I have spent
        the last four years coaching young athletes.
      </p>

      <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; line-height: 1.6;">
        I work with boys and girls ages 6 through 12, focusing on building confidence,
        skills, and a love for the game. My goal is to motivate each player while
        creating a positive and supportive team environment where children can grow
        both as athletes and individuals. I am committed to developing Fontana Fire FC
        into a competitive team within the SoCal Soccer League while helping every
        player reach their full potential.
